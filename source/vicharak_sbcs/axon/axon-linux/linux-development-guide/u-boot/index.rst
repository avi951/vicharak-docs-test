U-Boot (Universal Bootloader)
=============================

U-Boot `Das U-Boot` is an open-source bootloader that can be used on various
platforms such as ARM, X86, MIPS, RISC-V and many more.
It is the Universal Boot Loader project and is actually used to boot the
Linux kernel in your Vicharak board.
